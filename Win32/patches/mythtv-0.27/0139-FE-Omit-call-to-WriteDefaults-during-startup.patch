Subject: [PATCH 139/207] FE: Omit call to WriteDefaults during startup.

WriteDefaults is supposed to force the creation of missing settings
in the database.  Unfortunately the time overhead is quite large on
remote FE's and it's largely pointless.  Missing settings will assume
default values at runtime and in any case will be written to the dbase
when the user next invokes the relevant settings page.
